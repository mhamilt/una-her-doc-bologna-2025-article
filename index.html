<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Musical instruments present a uniquely challenging problem within the
heritage sector. Unlike many heritage objects, they are both aesthetic
artifacts and functional tools for producing music. This duality
complicates conservation approaches if there is to be a balance between
instrument’s physical integrity and its functional capability as a
sound-producing device. This balance is central to understanding the
broader philosophical and practical questions involved in the
conservation of musical instruments, and it invites a re-examination of
traditional frameworks to better encompass their hybrid nature. This
article will discuss the nature of musical instruments as heritage
objects and presents a recent project at Museo San Colombano in Bologna,
Italy, for which a new augmented replica harpsichord keyboard interface
was created. The goal of the project was to reintroduce the experience
of playing historical keyboard instruments. This project embodies the
intersection of conservation philosophy, technical innovation, and
museum practice, providing a practical case study on how living
interaction with heritage instruments might be facilitated while
safeguarding their material and cultural values.</p>
<h1 id="living-vs-dead-heritage">Living vs Dead Heritage</h1>
<p>Over recent decades, there has been a greater discourse around
‘living heritage’ versus the static, preservable ‘dead’ heritage <span
class="citation"
data-cites="poulios_moving_2010 smith_uses_2006">(Poulios 2010; Smith
2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Poulios critiques values-based conservation for treating the past as
something ‘dead,’ resulting in a discontinuity between past and present
experiences <span class="citation"
data-cites="poulios_moving_2010">(Poulios 2010)</span>. In contrast, the
‘living heritage’ paradigm emphasizes the ongoing, dynamic use and
relevance of heritage, advocating for the preservation of not just
physical artifacts but the practices, skills, and meanings that sustain
them in contemporary life.</p>
<p>While Poulios’ arguments are primarily directed at heritage sites and
ceremonial objects, the underlying philosophy is applicable to the wider
umbrella heritage objects, particularly musical instruments. There is
false dichotomy that presents conservation as a choice between heritage
as static and ‘dead’ or ‘living’.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The reality is more
complex and to treat heritage as perpetually living without
acknowledging its material finitude risks creating an ‘undead’ heritage,
neither truly alive nor preserved.</p>
<h1 id="a-new-value-for-conservation">A New Value for Conservation</h1>
<p>The justification for conserving heritage objects often rests upon a
complex matrix of values. <span class="citation"

<p>In addition to those above, I propose as a new category for musical
instruments and potentially all heritage objects that embody craft and
practice: ‘instructional value’. Instructional value refers to the
capacity of a heritage object to convey knowledge of practice,
technique, and skill intrinsic to its use and creation. A painting or
sculpture may reveal insights into artistic methods through ‘witness
marks’, the traces of the artist’s hand or materials. Similarly, a
musical instrument can serve as a pedagogical tool for performers,
luthiers, and scholars, instructing through its construction, wear
patterns, and interaction how music was historically produced and
experienced.</p>
<p>Instructional value may superficially appear to be a subset of
educational or academic value. I argue that this conflation obscures a
critical distinction between ‘descriptive knowledge’ (knowing that) and
‘procedural knowledge’ (knowing how). This division is essential to
resolving tensions in musical instrument conservation, where preserving
the physical object alone cannot fully capture its performative essence
without maintaining or reviving the skills and practices it
embodies.</p>
<p>The discourse around conservation frequently centres on the notion of
‘authenticity’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="pine_museums_2007 laurenson_authenticity_2006">(Pine II and
Gilmore 2007; Laurenson 2006)</span>, particularly regarding
historically informed performance <span class="citation"
data-cites="davies_authenticity_2001">(Davies 2001)</span>. Setting
aside the complexities and debates surrounding the meaning of
‘authenticity,’ it is important to recognize that the audience’s
experience often dominates discussions of musical heritage. Yet,
consider a scenario where a performer rehearses a piece 50 times before
performing to an audience of 50 who hears it once. Which value was
represented and by what magnitude in the course performance? I would
argue the performer’s experience – informed by the instrument’s unique
qualities – carries significant instructional value which is equal or
greater in magnitude to those values relevant to audience.</p>
<p>The performer, through hours of embodied interaction, acquires a
richer, more nuanced understanding, gained through tactile feedback and
‘gestural repertoires’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="levinson_music_1990">(Levinson 2011)</span> intrinsic to
playing the instrument. The instrument shapes the performance as much as
the performer shapes the music. This interplay is especially salient
when comparing, for instance, a modern Steinway piano with a historical
harpsichord, where differences in touch, sound production, and response
create distinct musical experiences. Put simply, this yet another
example of McLuhan’s maxim that “the medium is the message” <span
class="citation" data-cites="mcluhan_understanding_1964">(McLuhan and
Gordon 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>Conventional museum practice rarely permits visitors to handle or
play historical instruments. Though instruments may be in ‘playing
condition‘ they are not typically playable by the average museum
visitor. Instead, instruments cordoned off behind a – real or imagined –
‘red velvet cord,’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcalpine_sampling_2014">(McAlpine 2014)</span> displayed as
objects to be seen but not touched. This approach robs visitors of the
experience of vibro-tactile and kinaesthetic cues encoded into the
interface of the instrument. The challenge, then, is how to reintroduce
embodied interaction with historical instruments in ways that respect
conservation imperatives while restoring some degree of their living
function.</p>
<h1 id="musical-instruments-and-authenticity">Musical Instruments and
Authenticity</h1>
<p>Conserving musical instruments also raises the philosophical puzzle
akin to the ‘Ship of Theseus’. If an object’s components are replaced
one by one over time, at what point does it cease to be the original?
For instruments, how many keys, valves, bridges can be substituted? How
many patches and struts can be glued to soundboards before the
instrument ceases to historically authentic?</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="laurenson_authenticity_2006">Laurenson (2006)</span>
addresses authenticity by suggesting that the significance and function
of each component must guide decisions about conservation and change.
However, this approach simply ‘kicks the can down the road.’ For
example, Laurenson discusses the Walkman in Angus Fairhurst’s artwork
<em>Gallery Connections</em>, noting that its high value and
obsolescence require preserving the original artifact while replicating
its function through other means <span class="citation"
data-cites="laurenson_management_2005">(Laurenson 2005)</span>. This
approach demands further reflection when applied to historical musical
instruments already past the point of indefinite preservation while
retaining function.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="davies_authenticity_2001">Davies
(2001)</span> treatment of authenticity and substitution in musical
performance is influential but problematic in <span class="citation"
data-cites="laurenson_authenticity_2006">(Laurenson 2006)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Where the change in instrumentation, and adaptations made to the
music in the light of this, are significant, the result is a work
transcription that is distinct from its model. One does not transcribe a
work merely by crossing out the word ‘harpsichord’ on the score and
replacing it with ‘piano’ [...] however. Neither does the substitution
of the modern cello for its Baroque cousin result in a work
transcription.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="flushright">
<p>– <span class="citation"
data-cites="davies_authenticity_2001">(Davies 2001, 222)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Davies comparison conflates differences of degree (‘Baroque’ and
modern cello) with kind (harpsichord and pianoforte). The harpsichord
and pianoforte share a keyboard but employ fundamentally different
mechanisms for string excitation (plucking multiple registers vs. a
single hammer) resulting in a qualitative difference in the
vibro-tactile response. Conversely, the baroque and modern cello are
both bowed string instruments with identical excitation physics, despite
evolving dimensions and construction details.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Davies misunderstanding combined with confusion over Levinson’s emphasis
on ‘gestural repertoires’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="levinson_music_1990">(Levinson 2011)</span> provide an
example of the precariousness of ‘authenticity‘ and its citation in
<span class="citation"
data-cites="laurenson_authenticity_2006">(Laurenson 2006)</span> show
the consequences of its misapplication.</p>
<p>Davies also writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is relevant to add a second observation to this first: period
instruments, when played in the style of the day, sound different from
modern ones, but, as well, they sound better. They make clearer or more
salient features of the work that are aesthetically significant.”</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>To allow some leniency to Davies, there have scientific been studies
exploring these ideas, but they do result in Davies assessment here
being objectively incorrect. Given the recent studies by <span
class="citation"
data-cites="fritz_player_2012 fritz_soloist_2014 fritz_listener_2017">Fritz
et al. (2012, 2014, 2017)</span> on old violins – and assuming it is not
a stretch to apply the same conclusions to other string instruments –
Davies assessment here is objectively incorrect. This brings us back to
the instructional value of historical instruments: they are finite,
their sounds do not age well, they cannot be simply substituted without
compromise. How do we maintain a historical instruments capacity to
teach and communicate performance practice when it is deeply embedded in
their material and functional characteristics? If substitutions or
restorations alter these features, they risk severing vital links to
past knowledge and experience. The Tagliavini Collection in Bologna
<span class="citation"
data-cites="tagliavini_clavicembali_1987">(Tagliavini et al.
1987)</span>, housed at Museo San Colombano - Genus Bononiae and
renowned for its historical keyboard instruments, exemplifies this
dilemma.</p>

<p>With over fifty early keyboard instruments, primarily early plucked
stringed keyboards of Italian origin, the Tagliavini Collection stands
out as a valuable resource for musicologists, organologists and
musicians alike. Preserving the instruments’ authenticity was the
cornerstone of Ferdinando Tagliavini’s vision. This guiding principle
led him to collect instruments that could be restored to their playing
condition after minimal intervention.</p>
<p>In a collaboration between Museo San Colombano and the NEMUS project,
we designed an electronically augmented replica of a historical
harpsichord keyboard for interaction with digital musical instruments
(Figure <a href="#fig:mark2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mark2">1</a>). The goal was to enable visitors to
experience the harpsichord’s unique vibro-tactile qualities without
risking damage to the original artifacts and offer an immersive learning
environment. The keyboard incorporates an optical sensor system and
digital sound synthesis to replicate the physical feedback and acoustic
response of an original 15th century harpsichord in the Italian
style.</p>

<p>This new interface builds on the work of <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcalpine_sampling_2014">McAlpine (2014)</span> with the
Benton Fletcher Collection. However, user tests identified a limitation:
the commercially available weighted keys failed to provide an authentic
sense of interacting with a historical plucked keyboard instrument <span
class="citation" data-cites="mcalpine_sampling_2014">(McAlpine
2014)</span>. The “Tromba Moderna” project <span class="citation"
data-cites="baldwin_tromba_2016">(Baldwin et al. 2016)</span> approached
the issue of musical heritage playability by recreating and augmenting a
replica of a historical tromba marina. A piezo transducer was connected
to a sound synthesis engine and a driver within the instrument to
simulate the expected vibrations of a historical tromba marina. The new
keyboard inherits some aspects from the Tromba Moderna project and
addresses the limitations on the project by McAlpine. The optical
sensing technique for the keyboard is adapted from a similar project on
the piano by McPherson <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcpherson_portable_2013">(McPherson 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>The aesthetics of the interface attempt to leverage the human
tendency to be influenced by visual elements when making musical
judgments <span class="citation"

of being perceived as an ‘authentic’ by visitors. The rectangular frame
deviates from the traditional logarithmic (Figure <a
href="#fig:log-harp-comp" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:log-harp-comp">2</a>) form as the interface needed
be compact enough not to compromise space for exhibition of the
permanent display. The keyboard is hosted in the Oratory above the
museum’s main hall (Figure <a href="#fig:installed"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:installed">3</a>)
alongside unique examples of the Italian Renaissance building tradition,
including the 1547 harpsichord and the 1540 spinet by Alessandro
Trasuntino.</p>

<p>The interface is presently linked to a commercial software sampler;
however, the ultimate aim is to make the sound of instruments in the
collection that can no longer be maintained in playable condition
accessible. Museum visitors are invited to play the interface and listen
through a pair of headphones (Figure <a href="#fig:user"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:user">4</a>).</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The exhibition opened February 2025 and since then there have been
two rounds of preliminary feedback collected. The first from a pool of
20 people – consisting of staff, surveillance personnel and visitors who
were given training on the system – and expert feedback from curator
Catalina Vicens and luthier Roberto Livi. The second round as part of a
wider survey of the exhibition on a group of approximately 50 PhD
students. This survey was in a five-point scale format the results of
which are still being collected. From this group it was observed that
some did not play the interface. When these visitors were later asked
why they did not play the reasons given were that did not think they
were allowed to touch the instrument. This could be considered in
compliment for accuracy in the aesthetics of the keyboard but may also
suggest a wider problem with encouraging interaction in the museum
context.</p>

<p>Future design iterations will serve as a research probe to explore
the unique characteristics of the harpsichord and its impact on
performance much in the same manner as other musical haptics studies
<span class="citation"
data-cites="charalampos-saitis_musical_2018">(Charalampos Saitis and
Fritz 2018)</span>. A longer discussion, but one going beyond the scope
of this work, is whether the current setup or its future iterations may
be effectively used to build legitimate replicas of historical musical
instruments or even become a kind of new musical instrument
altogether.</p>
<p>I argue here that a holistic conservation framework for musical
instruments must integrate both values-based and living heritage
perspectives. Such a synthesis acknowledges the physical realities of
ageing instruments while honouring their performative and instructional
roles. Moreover, this integration opens pathways to novel conservation
strategies that extend beyond current paradigms.</p>
