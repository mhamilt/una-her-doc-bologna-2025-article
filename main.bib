 abstract  = {The Open Source Software (OSS) development model has emerged as an important competing paradigm to proprietary alternatives; however, insufficient research exists to understand the influence of some OSS project characteristics on the level of activity of the development process. A basic such characteristic is the selection of the project's software license. Drawing upon social movement theory, our study examined the relationship between OSS licenses and project activity. Some OSS licenses include a “copyleft” clause, which requires that if derivative products are to be released, it must be done under the license the original product had. We hypothesize that copylefted licenses, as opposed to noncopylefted licenses, are associated with higher developer membership and coding activity, faster development speed, and longer developer permanence in the project. To test the hypotheses, we used archival data sources of working OSS projects spanning several years of development time. We discuss practical and theoretical implications of the results as well as future research ideas.},

  abstract  = {Authenticity is integral to the enterprise that takes the delivery of the composer's work as its goal. In such cases, authenticity is an ontological requirement, not an interpretative option, though any performance recognizable as of a given work will be minimally authentic. Whether a performance must comply with the composer's instrumentation, phrasing, tempo, and dynamics depends on whether these features are work‐determinative for the musical tradition within which the work was created. Practical considerations, recently entrenched traditions, and the possibility that performers can take for granted the audience's prior familiarity with orthodox readings might count against the pursuit of ideal authenticity, but the territory to be explored in an interpretation should lie nearer the ideal than the minimum end of the spectrum along which authenticity is measured.},

This edition of McLuhan's best-known book both enhances its accessibility to a general audience and provides the full critical apparatus necessary for scholars. In Terrence Gordon's own words, McLuhan is in full flight already in the introduction, challenging us to plunge with him into what he calls 'the creative process of knowing.' Much to the chagrin of his contemporary critics McLuhan's preference was for a prose style that explored rather than explained. Probes, or aphorisms, were an indispensable tool with which he sought to prompt and prod the reader into an "understanding of how media operate" and to provoke reflection. In the 1960s McLuhan's theories aroused both wrath and admiration. It is intriguing to speculate what he might have to say 40 years later on subjects to which he devoted whole chapters such as Television, The Telephone, Weapons, Housing and Money. Today few would dispute that mass media have indeed decentralized modern living and turned the world into a global village. This critical edition features an appendix that makes available for the first time the core of the research project that spawned the book and individual chapter notes are supported by a glossary of terms, indices of subjects, names, and works cited.},

We examine the availability and completeness of resources needed to recreate DGM models, and discuss specific challenges encountered during such recreation. Drawing from this experience, we highlight key obstacles that hinder the long-term viability and reuse of DGMs in the NIME context, and propose guidelines to improve their documentation and future reuse within the community.},

Rather, the reenactment presents a novel instrument, realized through contemporary means, reflecting on contemporary concerns and within a contemporary context. We find reenactment complementary to conservation, maintenance, reconstruction and emulation in working with archival and museum objects. Our paper presents an analytic framework developed for use in workshop scenarios. This series of questions helps determine and understand which aspects of an instrument might be reenacted. To illustrate the process in action, we describe an example workshop wherein participants use methods of media archaeology, design fiction and role playing to imagine and reenact new features, affordances, contexts and applications of electronic instruments from a museum exhibition.},

  abstract     = {Experimental modal analysis (EMA) is the empirical study of the dynamic properties of structures under vibrational excitation. Non-contact EMA is advantageous when the target is susceptible to damage or contamination. In this study, we investigated non-contact EMA as we excite a cantilever beam using a collimated air impulse controlled by a solenoid valve. The reflected airwave from the beam surface was measured by a microphone array. The air actuation is calibrated by utilizing a separate pressure sensor that simultaneously measures the air impulse. The effect of changing the pressure and the opening time interval of the solenoid valve are investigated and found to be adequate for the frequency range of interest. The force transferred from the air impulse to the target depends on the upstream pressure, as well as the gap between the target and the nozzle. The effect of changing both the pressure and the gap distance between the target and the nozzle on the magnitude of force is investigated with a series of tests. Pre-processing is performed on the reflected signals to minimize the noise level, and the optimal gap distance between the sensor array and the target is found. The experimental tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to both accurately and cost-effectively measure structural dynamics in translational and rotational degrees using a non-contact excitation and sensor mechanism.},

  abstract     = {For decades, modal analysis has been a tool to gain insights in the vibrational and acoustical behavior of music instruments. This study provides a critical comparison of various experimental modal analysis approaches with the violin as a case study. Both contact and non-contact excitation and different acquisition approaches are considered. The influence of different boundary conditions (clamped, supported, free/free) on the vibrational response of the violin is investigated. The response is analyzed to extract relevant modal parameters (frequency, damping and mode shape) within the frequency range of 0--1000 Hz. The performance of the different approaches is evaluated in terms of (i) signature vibration modes, (ii) experimental reproducibility, (iii) contact requirement and (iv) cost of required equipment. Two optimal approaches are proposed for performing modal analysis on violins: a contact method for use in the violinmaker's practice, and a non-contact method for use with fragile instruments.},

@article{corradi_modal_2017,
  abstract     = {This paper deals with the development and validation of a finite element numerical model of a grand piano soundboard. The most important details of the manufacturing process are reproduced in this model. In particular, by modelling the gluing of the ribs and the bridges to the board, the curved geometry (the crown) and the residual stresses induced in the soundboard are taken into account. Experimental modal analysis results are presented at three stages of the manufacturing process of the same soundboard: (i) freely suspended soundboard before gluing the bridges, (ii) freely suspended soundboard including the two bridges, and (iii) soundboard attached to the piano frame. The experimental data at the first of these three stages are used to update the material properties of the finite element model, so as to minimise the difference between calculated and experimental vibration modes, in terms of both natural frequencies and mode shapes. The simulation of the other manufacturing stages is then performed without any additional tuning. Vibration modes obtained from experiments up to 400--450Hz are compared with those obtained through the numerical model. Point mobilities measured on the bridge at the different manufacturing stages are also shown and discussed. Above 200Hz, the mobilities measured on the bridge of the freely suspended soundboard and on the bridge of the soundboard fixed to the frame are very similar, thus showing that in this frequency range the effect of the soundboard local dynamic stiffness is predominant over boundary conditions. Finally, point mobility at the bridge is also calculated through the finite element model and compared to the experiments, with good agreement up to 4kHz.},

The LDV vibration output is an amplitude-modulated sine wave and mode shapes, defined along the scan line, may therefore be established by demodulation. Alternatively, in the frequency domain, the LDV output is a line spectrum, with sidebands centred on the excitation frequency and spaced at the scan frequency. The sideband amplitudes give series coefficients for the mode shape defined along the scan line---Fourier coefficients for a circular scan or, via a simple transform, polynomial coefficients for a sinusoidal straight line or area scan. Useful measurements can also be made, directed at a single point on a structure: a small-diameter circular scan will give the angular vibration of the structure at the centre of the circle; a conical scan, produced with a short-focus lens, will measure the translational vibration at the point of focus, in magnitude and direction.},

  abstract     = {Many researchers have sought explanations for the purported tonal superiority of Old Italian violins by investigating varnish and wood properties, plate tuning systems, and the spectral balance of the radiated sound. Nevertheless, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has been investigated scientifically only once very recently, and results showed a general preference for new violins and that players were unable to reliably distinguish new violins from old. The study was, however, relatively small in terms of the number of violins tested (six), the time allotted to each player (an hour), and the size of the test space (a hotel room). In this study, 10 renowned soloists each blind-tested six Old Italian violins (including five by Stradivari) and six new during two 75-min sessions---the first in a rehearsal room, the second in a 300-seat concert hall. When asked to choose a violin to replace their own for a hypothetical concert tour, 6 of the 10 soloists chose a new instrument. A single new violin was easily the most-preferred of the 12. On average, soloists rated their favorite new violins more highly than their favorite old for playability, articulation, and projection, and at least equal to old in terms of timbre. Soloists failed to distinguish new from old at better than chance levels. These results confirm and extend those of the earlier study and present a striking challenge to near-canonical beliefs about Old Italian violins.},

These qualities include the ability to project their sound more effectively in a concert hall---despite seeming relatively quiet under the ear of the player---compared with new violins. Although researchers have long tried to explain the ``mystery'' of Stradivari's sound, it is only recently that studies have addressed the fundamental assumption of tonal superiority. Results from two studies show that, under blind conditions, experienced violinists tend to prefer playing new violins over Old Italians. Moreover, they are unable to tell new from old at better than chance levels. This study explores the relative merits of Stradivari and new violins from the perspective of listeners in a hall. Projection and preference are taken as the two broadest criteria by which listeners might meaningfully compare violins. Which violins are heard better, and which are preferred? In two separate experiments, three new violins were compared with three by Stradivari. Projection was tested both with and without orchestral accompaniment. Projection and preference were judged simultaneously by dividing listeners into two groups. Results are unambiguous. The new violins projected better than the Stradivaris whether tested with orchestra or without, the new violins were generally preferred by the listeners, and the listeners could not reliably distinguish new from old. The single best-projecting violin was considered the loudest under the ear by players, and on average, violins that were quieter under the ear were found to project less well.},

  abstract     = {Most violinists believe that instruments by Stradivari and Guarneri "del Gesu" are tonally superior to other violins---and to new violins in particular. Many mechanical and acoustical factors have been proposed to account for this superiority; however, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has not yet been properly investigated. Player's judgments about a Stradivari's sound may be biased by the violin's extraordinary monetary value and historical importance, but no studies designed to preclude such biasing factors have yet been published. We asked 21 experienced violinists to compare violins by Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesu with high-quality new instruments. The resulting preferences were based on the violinists' individual experiences of playing the instruments under double-blind conditions in a room with relatively dry acoustics. We found that (i) the most-preferred violin was new; (ii) the least-preferred was by Stradivari; (iii) there was scant correlation between an instrument's age and monetary value and its perceived quality; and (iv) most players seemed unable to tell whether their most-preferred instrument was new or old. These results present a striking challenge to conventional wisdom. Differences in taste among individual players, along with differences in playing qualities among individual instruments, appear more important than any general differences between new and old violins. Rather than searching for the "secret" of Stradivari, future research might best focused on how violinists evaluate instruments, on which specific playing qualities are most important to them, and on how these qualities relate to measurable attributes of the instruments, whether old or new.},

To examine the impact of visual information on expert judgment and its predictive validity for performance outcomes, this set of seven experiments in the domain of music offers a conservative test of the relative influence of vision versus audition. People consistently report that sound is the most important source of information in evaluating performance in music. However, the findings demonstrate that people actually depend primarily on visual information when making judgments about music performance. People reliably select the actual winners of live music competitions based on silent video recordings, but neither musical novices nor professional musicians were able to identify the winners based on sound recordings or recordings with both video and sound. The results highlight our natural, automatic, and nonconscious dependence on visual cues. The dominance of visual information emerges to the degree that it is overweighted relative to auditory information, even when sound is consciously valued as the core domain content.},

  abstract     = {The modular feedback keyboard (MFK) design that we describe in this article was conceived and constructed at ACROE. It was first presented to the public on 17 October, 1989 in Grenoble at the opening celebration of our center's new studio. The system we present is the prototype of a more general device, and its construction is the result of research into the relationship between instrument and performer within the framework of a system for realtime sound synthesis and computer-assisted musical creation. The first feature of this device is that it is a gestural control system with feedback for the tactile senses-it enables actual fingering of a physical instrument to be simulated. The second important feature is that this is a modular system: the piano- or organ-type keyboard is its nominal form, but its mechanical morphology can be modified and easily configured for other applications or types of performance interfaces.},

  abstract     = {When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the effects of latency (0-20ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms $\pm$ 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without significantly affecting the timing performance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

The Novint Falcon force feedback interfaceis used to scan through soundfiles as a subject moves their hand horizontallyfrom left to right, and to relay information about volume, frequency content,noisiness, or potentially any analysable parameter back to the subject throughforces acting on their hand. General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject's hand movements.Presentation of audio information in this manner could be beneficial for`pre-feeling' as a method for selecting material to play during a liveperformance, assisting visually impaired audio engineers, and as a generalaugmentation of standard audio editing environments.},

Divided into two parts, part I examines the tactile aspects of music performance and perception, discussing how they affect user experience and performance in terms of usability, functionality and perceived quality of musical instruments. Part II presents engineering, computational, and design approaches and guidelines that have been applied to render and exploit haptic feedback in digital musical interfaces. Musical Haptics introduces an emerging field that brings together engineering, human-computer interaction, applied psychology, musical aesthetics, and music performance. The latter, defined as the complex system of sensory-motor interactions between musicians and their instruments, presents a well-defined framework in which to study basic psychophysical, perceptual, and biomechanical aspects of touch, all of which will inform the design of haptic musical interfaces. Tactile and proprioceptive cues enable embodied interaction and inform sophisticated control strategies that allow skilled musicians to achieve high performance and expressivity. The use of haptic feedback in digital musical interfaces is expected to enhance user experience and performance, improve accessibility for disabled persons, and provide an effective means for musical tuition and guidance.},

@inproceedings{moro_a-platform_2020,
  abstract  = {On several acoustic and electromechanical keyboard instruments, the produced sound is not always strictly dependent exclusively on a discrete key velocity parameter, and minute gesture details can affect the final sonic result. By contrast, subtle variations in articulation have a relatively limited effect on the sound generation when the keyboard controller uses the MIDI standard, used in the vast majority of digital keyboards. In this paper we present an embedded platform that can generate sound in response to a controller capable of sensing the continuous position of keys on a keyboard. This platform enables the creation of keyboard-based DMIs which allow for a richer set of interaction gestures than would be possible through a MIDI keyboard, which we demonstrate through two example instruments. First, in a Hammond organ emulator, the sensing device allows to recreate the nuances of the interaction with the original instrument in a way a velocity-based MIDI controller could not. Second, a nonlinear waveguide flute synthesizer is shown as an example of the expressive capabilities that a continuous-keyboard controller opens up in the creation of new keyboard-based DMIs.},

However, speech perception is normally regarded as a purely auditory process. The study reported here demonstrates a previously unrecognised influence of vision upon speech perception. It stems from an observation that, on being shown a film of a young woman's talking head, in which repeated utterances of the syllable {$[$}ba{$]$} had been dubbed on to lip movements for {$[$}ga{$]$}, normal adults reported hearing {$[$}da{$]$}. With the reverse dubbing process, a majority reported hearing {$[$}bagba{$]$} or {$[$}gaba{$]$}. When these subjects listened to the soundtrack from the film, without visual input, or when they watched untreated film, they reported the syllables accurately as repetitions of {$[$}ba{$]$} or {$[$}ga{$]$}. Subsequent replications confirm the reliability of these findings; they have important implications for the understanding of speech perception.},

  abstract     = {A piano key prototype actuated by a custom-made linear actuator is proposed to enhance the touch of digital pianos by reproducing the force feedback of an acoustic piano action. This paper presents the design and the validation of the haptic device. The approach exploits a multibody model to compute the action dynamics and the corresponding force on the key in real time. More specifically, a grand piano model that includes the five action bodies, its geometry and the specific force laws, is computed in the haptic device. A presizing step along with Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis produced an especially made actuator satisfying the design requirements, in particular the highly dynamic nature of the force to be transmitted. Force peaks, up to 50 (N) in less than 20 (ms), are reachable with low power consumption. Compared to previous solutions: (i) the key physical characteristics are preserved; (ii) the feedback is based on a real-time multibody model that is easily configurable and interchangeable; (iii) an experimental validation of the actuator within the prototype is developed and demonstrates its feasibility. The results confirm that the voice coil can produce suitable haptic feedback. In particular, rendering a grand piano action within the device shows promising haptic force profiles.},

@inproceedings{mcalpine_sampling_2014,
  abstract  = {In the last decade, the heritage sector has had to adapt to a shifting cultural landscape of public expectations and attitudes towards ownership and intellectual property. One way it has done this is to focus on each visitor{’}s encounter and provide them with a sense of experiential authenticity.There is a clear desire by the public to engage with music collections in this way, and a sound museological rationale for providing such access, but the approach raises particular curatorial problems, specifically how do we meaningfully balance access with the duty to preserve objects for future generations?This paper charts the development of one such project. Based at Fenton House in Hampstead, and running since 2008, the project seeks to model digitally the keyboard instruments in the Benton Fletcher Collection and provide a dedicated interactive exhibit, which allows visitors to view all of the instruments in situ, and then play them through a custom-built two-manual MIDI controller with touch-screen interface.We discuss the approach to modelling, which uses high-definition sampling, and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the exhibit as it currently stands, with particular focus on its key shortcoming: at present, there is no way to effectively model the key feel of a historic keyboard instrument.This issue is of profound importance, since the feel of any instrument is fundamental to its character, and shapes the way performers relate to it. The issue is further compounded if we are to consider a single dedicated keyboard as being the primary mode of interface for several instrument models of different classes, each with its own characteristic feel.We conclude by proposing an outline solution to this problem, detailing early work on a real-time adaptive haptic keyboard interface that changes its action in response to sampled resistance curves, measured on a key-by-key basis from the original instruments.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we reflect on the focus of ``newness'' in NIME research and practice and argue that there is a missing O (for ``Old'') in framing our academic discourse. A systematic review of the last year's conference proceedings reveals that most papers do, indeed, present new instruments, interfaces, or pieces of technology. Comparably few papers focus on the prolongation of existing NIMEs. Our meta-analysis identifies four main categories from these papers: (1) reuse, (2) update, (3) complement, and (4) long-term engagement. We discuss how focusing more on these four types of NIME development and engagement can be seen as an approach to increase sustainability.},

@inproceedings{mcpherson_the-space_2013,
  abstract  = {This paper addresses the question of how to extend the capabilities of a well-established interface in a way that respects users' existing expertise. The piano-style keyboard is among the most widely used and versatile of digital musical interfaces. However, it lacks the ability to alter the pitch of a note after it has been played, a limitation which prevents the performer from executing common expressive techniques including vibrato and pitch bending. We present a system for controlling pitch from the keyboard surface using capacitive touch sensors to measure the locations of the player's fingers on the keys. The large community of trained pianists makes the keyboard a compelling target for augmentation, but it also poses a challenge: how can a musical interface be extended while making use of the existing techniques performers have spent thousands of hours learning? In this paper, user studies with conservatory pianists explore the constraints of traditional keyboard technique and evaluate the usability of the continuous pitch control system. The paper also discusses implications for the extension of other established interfaces in musical and non-musical contexts.},

It is based on the well-known autocorrelation method with a number of modifications that combine to prevent errors. The algorithm has several desirable features. Error rates are about three times lower than the best competing methods, as evaluated over a database of speech recorded together with a laryngograph signal. There is no upper limit on the frequency search range, so the algorithm is suited for high-pitched voices and music. The algorithm is relatively simple and may be implemented efficiently and with low latency, and it involves few parameters that must be tuned. It is based on a signal model (periodic signal) that may be extended in several ways to handle various forms of aperiodicity that occur in particular applications. Finally, interesting parallels may be drawn with models of auditory processing.},

This is the main objective of the non-destructive method proposed in this study. The proposed inverse approach, based on both vibrational experiment data and Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU), is successfully applied to a violin soundboard made of flax-epoxy composite. Results show that, by minimizing the discrepancy between the experimental and numerical data, three rigidities and three loss factors can be determined simultaneously. The identified values of the constitutive elastic moduli and longitudinal loss factor are in agreement with those determined using quasi-static tests and dynamic mechanical analysis.},

It is generally alleged that the design choices of acoustic guitar bracing patterns lead to a specific sound of the instrument. However, in the presence of strong uncertainties due to variability of material properties and climatic conditions, the robustness of the soundboard dynamics has yet to be investigated. In this study, three types of bracing patterns are studied using physics-based models and stochastic analyses are performed to account for material and climatic uncertainties. It is shown that the choice of a brace design leads, at least in the low frequency domain, to a dynamic behaviour that is not stackable with another design, even in the presence of strong aleatory uncertainties. This assessment supports the conjecture that guitar brace design choices have a greater impact than material variability where guitar soundboard dynamics are concerned. More generally, these results illustrate the usefulness of detailed physics-based models in the understanding, design and making of guitars.},

By employing vibrometry and modal analysis followed by finite element model updating, the vibro-mechanical properties (specific stiffness in longitudinal (L) and radial (R) directions and shear LR plane, and associated damping) of the indented growth rings spruce were identified and implemented in a numerical model of a violin. Results have revealed a significant increase in specific moduli in R direction and LR plane and decrease in L direction of spruce wood in the presence of indented growth rings, therefore accompanied by a reduction in anisotropic elastic properties, in comparison to spruce without these patterns. These properties led to changes in violin dynamics, globally increasing resonance frequencies and changing the shape of the vibration modes. The simulated frequency response function of the violin at the bridge suggested a global shift of the admittance of the bridge toward higher frequencies. These results suggest a potential impact of indented growth rings of spruce on the acoustic properties of instruments.},

In this paper we present a study that assesses the effects of delayed auditory feedback on the timing accuracy and judgments of instrument quality for two groups of participants: professional percussionists and non-percussionist amateur musicians. The amounts of delay tested in this study are relatively small in comparison to similar studies of auditory delays in a musical context (0 ms, 10 ms, 10 ms $\pm$ 3 ms, 20 ms). We found that both groups rated the zero latency condition as higher quality for a series of quality measures in comparison to 10 ms $\pm$ 3 ms and 20 ms latency, but did not show a significant difference in rating between 10 ms latency and zero latency. Professional percussionists were more aware of the latency conditions and showed less variation of timing under the latency conditions, although this ability decreased as the temporal demands of the task increased. We compare our findings from each group and discuss them in relation to latency in interactive digital systems more generally and experimentally similar work on sensorimotor control and rhythmic performance.},

  abstract  = {Recording sounds from novel perspectives is of particular interest in the creation of immersive sound design. Sound design that provides an immersive experience for the listener is increasingly relevant, with widespread use across music, film, computer games and other media modalities. Laser doppler vibrometry (LDV) is a non-contact technique for the measurement of mechanical vibration. LDV is used in a wide range of research and engineering applications, including biophysics, microelectronics, and the automotive industries. In audio and acoustics research, LDV can be used instead of piezoelectric transducers where high sensitivity, non-contact measurements are important to ensure the accurate capture of vibrations over a wide frequency range. However, while its use for data gathering and analysis is very well established, its potential as a creative tool in immersive sound design has seen very little research. In this paper we show that LDV can provide a unique and creatively valuable sonic perspective on sound making objects. We demonstrate how an LDV system can be optimised for such use, and allow high quality vibration recordings to be made and used in the creation of immersive sound and music experiences. The results build on what is possible with commonly used piezoelectric transducers by harnessing the non-invasive nature of LDV. The ability to measure vibration at a single point with very wide spectral resolution, and to focus on the vibration of both large and tiny objects, reveals a new sonic world with significant potential in the development of immersive sound design.},

  abstract     = {Curators of heritage musical instruments are faced with a number of recurring questions concerning the objects in their collection. Can the instrument be played without damaging it? How might it best be restored? Can we understand how and why the instrument evolved in the way it did and the impact of the different steps in its construction? Indeed, the impact of the different steps in the assembly of a musical instrument must be anticipated in order to assess its playability. Curators may question whether the state of internal stress, deliberately introduced by the instrument maker during the assembly process, should be restored after it has relaxed over time. These questions are typically answered through expert judgment. Meanwhile, it may be possible to leverage detailed physics-based models to enrich the decision support in the museum environment. This novel strategy is illustrated in the present study to investigate the importance of the different steps in the assembly process in order to guide the restoration process. In particular, numerical and experimental studies that have been carried out on a facsimile of the soundboard of the Christoph Koch's archlute of 1654 (E.546) with the objective of quantifying the impact of its assembly and gluing processes on the low frequency vibratory behavior. It is shown that a nominal non validated numerical model is able to predict trends, validated via experimental studies, that can be useful in understanding the impact of the assembly process in order to guide future restorative measures. *Recurring questions facing curators of heritage musical instruments concerning their state of playability.*Museum decisions about instrument restoration and playability can be informed by leveraging detailed physics-based models.*Internal mechanical stresses can be purposely introduced by the luthier during the musical instrument assembly process.*Non-validated physics-based models can be leveraged to predict useful trends.*Uncertainty in gluing process has a higher impact on the soundboard's low frequency behaviour than its assembly process.},

  abstract     = {Some of the most prized woods used for the backs and sides of acoustic guitars are expensive, rare, and from unsustainable sources. It is unclear to what extent back woods contribute to the sound and playability qualities of acoustic guitars. Six steel-string acoustic guitars were built for this study to the same design and material specifications except for the back/side plates which were made of woods varying widely in availability and price (Brazilian rosewood, Indian rosewood, mahogany, maple, sapele, and walnut). Bridge-admittance measurements revealed small differences between the modal properties of the guitars which could be largely attributed to residual manufacturing variability rather than to the back/side plates. Overall sound quality ratings, given by 52 guitarists in a dimly lit room while wearing welder's goggles to prevent visual identification, were very similar between the six guitars. The results of a blinded ABX discrimination test, performed by another subset of 31 guitarists, indicate that guitarists could not easily distinguish the guitars by their sound or feel. Overall, the results suggest that the species of wood used for the back and sides of a steel-string acoustic guitar has only a marginal impact on its body mode properties and perceived sound.},

@article{alain_cancellation_2023,
  abstract     = {A model of early auditory processing is proposed in which each peripheral channel is processed by a delay-and-subtract cancellation filter, tuned independently for each channel with a criterion of minimum power. For a channel dominated by a pure tone or a resolved partial of a complex tone, the optimal delay is its period. For a channel responding to harmonically-related partials, the optimal delay is their common fundamental period. Each peripheral channel is thus split into two subchannels, one that is cancellation-filtered and the other not. Perception can involve either or both, depending on the task. The model is illustrated by applying it to the masking asymmetry between pure tones and narrowband noise: a noise target masked by a tone is more easily detectable than a tone target masked by noise. The model is one of a wider class of models, monaural or binaural, that cancel irrelevant stimulus dimensions so as to attain invariance to competing sources. Similar to occlusion in the visual domain, cancellation yields sensory evidence that is incomplete, thus requiring Bayesian inference of an internal model of the world along the lines of Helmholtz{’}s doctrine of unconscious inference.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The McGurk effect is a well‐known phenomenon in speech perception that demonstrates how visual information for articulation can change an auditory speech percept [H. McGurk and J. McDonald, Nature 264, 746–748 (1976)]. The McGurk effect is often used to support the notion that a specialized speech module exists in the nervous system, which processes all information related to speech regardless of modality. In the current study subjects were presented with both consistent and discrepant audio‐visual tokens of plucks and bows on a cello. Audio stimuli consisted of a continuum of tokens that ranged from plucks to bows. The tokens were dubbed synchronously on to a video image of a musician either plucking or bowing a cello. It was observed that subjects' auditory judgments could be affected by the visual stimuli suggesting that the McGurk effect might not be special to speech. These results will be discussed in terms of auditory, fuzzy logical model, motor, and ecological theories of speech perception.},

A recent study claims that ‘skilled musicians are not subject to’ this effect. It is not clear, however, if this is intended to mean that skilled musicians do not experience the McGurk effect at all, or if they just experience it to a lesser magnitude than non-musicians. The study also does not statistically demonstrate either of these conclusions, as it does report a numerical (albeit non-significant) McGurk effect for musicians and does not report a significant difference between musicians' and non-musicians’ McGurk effect sizes. This article reports a pre-registered, higher-power replication of that study (using twice the sample size and changing from a between- to a within-participants manipulation). Contrary to the original study's conclusion, we find that musicians do show a large and statistically significant McGurk effect and that their effect is no smaller than that of non-musicians.},

In the present study, we attempted to find an analogue of the McGurk effect by using nonspeech stimuli--the discrepant audiovisual tokens of plucks and bows on a cello. The results of an initial experiment revealed that subjects' auditory judgments were influenced significantly by the visual pluck and bow stimuli. However, a second experiment in which speech syllables were used demonstrated that the visual influence on consonants was significantly greater than the visual influence observed for pluck-bow stimuli. This result could be interpreted to suggest that the nonspeech visual influence was not a true McGurk effect. In a third experiment, visual stimuli consisting of the words pluck and bow were found to have no influence over auditory pluck and bow judgments. This result could suggest that the nonspeech effects found in Experiment 1 were based on the audio and visual information's having an ostensive lawful relation to the specified event. These results are discussed in terms of motor-theory, ecological, and FLMP approaches to speech perception.},
